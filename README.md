# YetAnotherBlog

This project is created as an exercise in C#, ASP.NET, HTML, and CSS. Once completed, I will likely use this project to set up a personal website.

## Status as of April 10, 2018
This project is, for my purposes, almost fully finished. I have delayed implementing a search function for the moment, as it won't be necessary for my site. Pagination will be done tomorrow.
The content management services are complete, however I still need to add a page for the admin to adjust certain settings for the blog such as whether to allow user registration. Ignoring searching,
I expect to finish this project this week and in the next two to three weeks to have it deployed on a personal site.

## Status as of March 11, 2018

This project about half completed. The admin can write new posts, and registered users can reply to them. The biggest thing left to implement is searching and pagination, which
will be done in the next week. Once that is complete, for my use, this project will be complete and I will likely deploy this project to a personal website.
However, I plan to add, as time allows, an admin panel to customize the site, and management pages for managing user accounts.
