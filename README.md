# YetAnotherBlog

This project is created as an exercise in C#, ASP.NET, HTML, and CSS. Once completed, I will likely use this project to set up a personal website.

## Status as of March 11, 2018

This project about half completed. The admin can write new posts, and registered users can reply to them. The biggest thing left to implement is searching and pagination, which
will be done in the next week. Once that is complete, for my use, this project will be complete and I will likely deploy this project to a personal website.
However, I plan to add, as time allows, an admin panel to customize the site, and management pages for managing user accounts.
